\title{Define a formula for the convolution model}
\usage{
\method{id_formula}{idbrms_convolution}(data, scale = ~1, cmean = ~1, lcsd = ~1, ...)

id_formula(data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame as produced by \code{prepare} that must contain the date,
location (as loc), primary (the data that the outcome is a convolution of)
and secondary (the observation of interest. Should have class
"idbrms_convolution".}

\item{scale}{Formula for the scaling of primary observations to secondary
observations.}

\item{cmean}{Formula for the convolution mean. Defaults to intercept
only.}

\item{lcsd}{Formula for the logged convolution standard deviation. Defaults
to intercept only.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for method.}
